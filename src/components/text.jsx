            In this level, a mysterious person will send you a survival manual to help

            You should send proper TCP segments to complete a TCP connection.

                It is also possible to terminate the connection by a <b>3-way handshake</b>,
                when host A sends a FIN and host B replies with a FIN & ACK (combining two steps into one) and host A replies with an ACK.
